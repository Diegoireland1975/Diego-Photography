# Diego-Photography
A kind of a Portfolio of some of my Photo I took in all my Trips.
Very simple and minimal layout, with a nice animation on scroll.
I also applied a simple animation with a keyframe on the main title and landing photo and fancybox for the gallery
Technologies used:
Flexbox, Fancybox and AOS for scrolling animations
